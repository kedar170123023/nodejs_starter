<h1>Contribution Guide</h1>

* Clone Navprayas Backend Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Navprayas-A-group-of-Innovative-thought/Navprayas-Backend.git
```

* <span class="highlight" style="background-color:inherit"><span class="colour" style="color:var(--vscode-markdown-wysList)">You will see a Navprayas-Backend folder</span></span>
* `cd Navprayas-Backend`
* Install all dependencies
* `npm install`
* To check your current branch -Â `git branch`
  
   **Repeat Point : commands to be reused**

* Now you have been assigned test. 
* Open Github and Create a remote branch in test in origin(remote). 
* Come to your local computer and
  
* `git checkout test` to switch to local test branch (test branch already exists in remote so no need to create).
* `git pull` to get changes from remote test branch to your local test branch. Note `git pull` pulls all changes from (current)remote branch to your current local branch, it does not work necessarily only master branch but is true for all branches.
* Now do your work.Then add your changes.
* `git add .`
* Then commit your changes.
* `git commit -m "your message"`
* Your commit should answer what this commit will do. Answer should be This commit will "your message".
* Now push your branch work to Navprayas backend repo. Note you are in test branch.
* `git push` will push all your local changes to remote test.
* Open you github and select branch test
* Now create a pull request to development branch
* Then Admin will merge your request to master accordingly.
* For another issue, first go to **Repeat point**.


<h3>Instructions for Files</h3>
